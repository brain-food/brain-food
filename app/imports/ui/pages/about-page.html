            against homework assignments and crazy exams, but it's not easy to keep track of your eating habits when the
            next deadline is always around the corner. Brain_Food was made to provide students a quick resource for
            healthy eating ideas, and to give students at UH Manoa information on how to buy healthy foods and
            ingredients nearby campus.</p>

            needed to follow a recipe from start to finish, and the estimated cost of recipe ingredients.</p>
